## What is HyPanel?

HyPanel is the first complete platform built specifically for Hytale. Unlike generic game server panels, HyPanel understands Hytale's unique modding capabilities, world structure, and community needs.

### Core Features

1. **Server Infrastructure**: One-click server deployment, smart hibernation (servers sleep when empty to save costs), multi-instance management, automatic backups, and real-time monitoring.

2. **Hytahub Integration**: Strategic partnership with Hytahub, the largest Hytale content marketplace. One-click installation of mods, assets, maps, and configurations directly from the community.

3. **The Forge (Visual Logic Editor)**: Create game logic without code. Design events, quests, rewards, and complex interactions using a drag-and-drop node-based editor. Export to JSON or directly deploy to your server.

4. **Community Tools**: Built-in forums, Discord integration, player analytics, moderation tools, and community management features.

5. **Monetization**: Integrated stores, subscriptions, battle passes, and marketplace revenue sharing for creators and server owners.
