<p class="lead">We're excited to announce that Hytahub.com and HyPanel.net are merging under one unified brand: <strong>HYTAHUB</strong>. By joining forces, we'll deliver better tools, services, and experiences for the entire Hytale community.</p>

This is a major milestone in our journey. Two projects, one vision — and now, one team working together to build the ultimate platform for Hytale.

## Why the Merger?

From the beginning, both Hytahub and HyPanel shared the same goal: to create the best possible ecosystem for Hytale creators and players. We realized that combining our efforts would allow us to move faster, build better, and serve you more effectively.

Instead of two separate teams working on parallel projects, we now have a unified team focused on a single, cohesive platform.

## What This Means for You

This merger brings exciting improvements across the board:

### ✨ Better Performance and Stability
By consolidating our infrastructure, we can invest more resources into making everything faster and more reliable.

### ✨ Unified Services in a Single Ecosystem
No more jumping between platforms. Everything you need — hosting, content, tools — will be in one place under the Hytahub umbrella.

### ✨ Faster Updates and Improved Support
One team, one focus. This means quicker feature releases and better support for our community.

### ✨ More Tools for Creators, Clients, and Partners
We're expanding our toolkit. Expect new features designed specifically for server owners, mod creators, and content developers.

## Join the Official HYTAHUB Discord

We're bringing everyone together in one place: the **official HYTAHUB Discord**. If you were part of the HyPanel community, we invite you to join us:

This is where you'll find the latest updates, connect with other community members, and get direct support from the team.

## What's Next?

Over the next few weeks, we'll be rolling out improvements and keeping you informed every step of the way. Here's what to expect:

- **Website updates** — Both sites will be updated to reflect the new branding
- **Service integrations** — Seamless connection between all Hytahub services
- **New features** — The first wave of new tools is already in development
