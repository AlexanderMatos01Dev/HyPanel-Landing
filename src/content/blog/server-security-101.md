Security is often an afterthought until it's too late. 

## DDoS Protection

HyPanel comes with enterprise-grade DDoS protection standard. We filter traffic at the edge, so your server never sees the bad packets.

## Anti-Exploit

Prevent crash clients from taking down your server. Our custom fork of the server jar patches known exploits before they become public.

## Backups

The ultimate security is a good backup. Configure daily off-site backups in your HyPanel dashboard.
