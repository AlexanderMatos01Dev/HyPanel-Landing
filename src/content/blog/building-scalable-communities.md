Growing a community is an art. It's not just about marketing; it's about culture.

## The First 100 Players

When you're small, you can talk to everyone. Do it. Build relationships. These early adopters are your future moderators and admins.

## Scaling Up

As you grow, you need systems.
*   **Automated Onboarding:** Use bots to guide new players.
*   **Clear Rules:** Ambiguity causes drama. Be precise.
*   **Events:** Regular events keep people coming back.

## The HyPanel Advantage
