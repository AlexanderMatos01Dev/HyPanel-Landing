<p class="lead">You have 10 seconds to convince a new player to stay.</p>

## Navigation
Make it obvious where to go. "Survival -> Right", "Creative -> Left". Don't make them read a wall of text.

## Performance
Keep the lobby lightweight. No complex redstone, no 500 holograms. If they lag in the lobby, they will leave before they even see the game.
