<p class="lead">We are just getting started. 2025 is going to be a massive year for HyPanel, with features that blur the line between hosting platform and game engine.</p>

## Q1: AI-Assisted Moderation

Moderating a large community is tough. Our new AI module, **Sentinel**, will assist your staff by:

*   **Contextual Chat Analysis:** Detecting toxicity not just by keywords, but by intent.
*   **X-Ray Detection:** Analyzing player movement patterns to flag potential cheaters automatically.
*   **Smart Reporting:** Grouping similar reports to help staff clear queues faster.

## Q2: Cross-Server Syncing

For networks with multiple servers (Lobby, Survival, Skyblock), syncing data has always been a pain point requiring external databases and complex plugins.

**HyPanel Sync** will introduce native, one-click synchronization for:
*   Inventories
*   Economy Balances
*   Permissions & Ranks
*   Player Stats

## Q3: The Marketplace

We are opening up the HyPanel ecosystem. Developers will be able to create and sell:
*   **Forge Blueprints:** Pre-made visual scripts for minigames.
*   **Web Themes:** Custom skins for the HyPanel user interface.
*   **Server Templates:** Full server setups deployable in one click.

## Q4: Mobile App 2.0

Manage your server from anywhere. The new mobile app will feature a full console terminal, push notifications for server events, and a mobile-optimized version of The Forge editor.
