<p class="lead">Hytale is coming. Is your community ready?</p>

## Official Server Tech
Hypixel Studios has confirmed that Hytale will have a shared source server model. This means we can modify the server code directly, unlike Minecraft where we have to hack it with Bukkit/Forge.

## HyPanel Readiness
We are already building the infrastructure to support Hytale nodes on day one. Our "The Forge" visual editor is specifically designed with Hytale's scripting engine in mind.
