Our roadmap is driven by you. Here are the top features requested by the community this month.

## 1. Custom Domain Support
You want to use `play.yourserver.com`. We hear you. We are integrating Cloudflare DNS directly into HyPanel for one-click custom domains.

## 2. Team Management
Running a server is a team effort. We are adding granular permission roles so you can give your moderators access to the console without giving them access to billing.

## 3. Mobile App
"Can I restart my server from my phone?" Yes. The HyPanel mobile companion app is in early design stages.
